        <h3>Financing</h3>
        <p>On March 4, 2015, PetSmart, Inc. (“PetSmart,” formerly, Argos Merger Sub, Inc.) issued $1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due 2023 (the “notes”) in a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and entered into a term loan credit facility (the “term facility”) and a revolving asset-based credit facility (the “ABL facility”, together with the term facility, the “credit facilities”) with certain lenders. On May 15, 2015 PetSmart entered into an amendment of the term facility to reduce the interest rate applicable to borrowings thereunder by 75 basis points. PetSmart will make annual audited financial statements, together with a Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”), available within 90 days (120 days for the fiscal year 2015) after the end of our fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday closest to January 31. In addition, we will make unaudited quarterly financial statements, together with an MD&A, available within 45 days (60 days for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2015) after the end of each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year and certain required current reports available promptly after the occurrence of such reportable event. The financial information will be made available only to lenders, holders of the notes, bona fide prospective investors of the notes, bona fide securities analysts and bona fide market makers; provided that we may deny access to any competitively-sensitive information to any such person to the extent that we determine in good faith that the provision of such information would be competitively harmful to us. Such person requesting access to our financial information is required to (i) treat all such reports (and the information contained therein) as confidential, (ii) not use such reports and the information contained therein for any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the notes and (iii) not publicly disclose any such reports (and the information contained therein). The reports will be provided to the administrative agents for the respective credit facilities for further distribution to lenders under the credit facilities and will be posted on a secure web site, which can be accessed only by holders of the notes, bona fide prospective investors of the notes, bona fide securities analysts and bona fide market makers. </p>
        <h3>Delivery</h3>
        <p>PetSmart will host an investor teleconference call for term loan lenders, holders of the notes, bona fide prospective investors of the notes, bona fide securities analysts and bona fide market makers after the reports are posted. Prior to the investor call, PetSmart will issue a public press release announcing the date and time of the call and directing holders of the notes, prospective investors of the notes, securities analysts and market makers to contact the company to gain access to the secure web site, which will contain details on how to access the call. The lenders under the credit facilities will receive details on how to access the call from the administrative agents for the respective credit facilities. </p>
